## Dotfiles installation
*Dwm is the default wm, just change xinitrc if you want to use bspwm or xmonad.*
*Read the commented lines in [bootstrap](https://github.com/hoaxdream/void-bootstrap) scripts and change accordingly for your system*
```sh
- $ xbps-install -Syu git
- $ git clone https://github.com/hoaxdream/void-bootstrap.git
- $ cd void-bootstrap
- $ ./1_pkginstall          # edit according to packages you want to install.
- $ ./2_dotsetup            # clone my dotfiles, including suckless builds and install them.
- $ sudo ./3_postinstall    # set UUID of my spare drive to fstab, edit accordingly.
- $ sudo ./4_finalize       # set dbus, also delete and make directory.
- $ sudo reboot
- $ dot up                  # this command do --assumed-unchanged and delete LICENSE, README.md in $HOME
- $ dot res                 # this command do --no-assumed-unchanged and restore LICENSE, README.md in $HOME
- $ dot status              # check git status
- $ dot add                 # add file
